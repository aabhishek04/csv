;; General settings control basic behavior of the plugin
;;
;; * cacheConfig - set to true to cache the parsed configuration data
;;   so it doesn't get parsed on each request.
;;
;; * alwaysEnableController - Set to true to always enable the
;;   AssetsController. Generally you will want to disable the controller
;;   in production, as it could allow an attacker to request expensive
;;   resources repeatedly. However, if you need the controller available
;;   in production. You can enable this flag.
;;
;; * themes - Define which plugins are themes. Theme plugins will be scanned
;;   for asset files when building targets containing themed files.

;; _filters, _targets and other keys prefixed with this value
;; are connected when the ini file is parsed.
;;
;; * cachePath - is where built files will be output
;; * timestamp - Set to true to add a timestamp to build files.
;; * paths - An array of paths where files used in builds can be found
;;   Supports glob expressions.
;; * filters - A list of filters to be applied to all build files
;;   using this extension.
;; * baseUrl - Set the base url this type of asset is served off of, good
;;   for using with CDN's
